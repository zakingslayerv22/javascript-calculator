Taking on The Odin Project's Calculator Project was very beneficial as I picked up a ton of skills as during the project. It gave me an opportunity to practice especially methods that that we learned in previous lessons. I realize that arrays are powerful in JavaScript and I know that the work I did here was merely scratching the surface on the potential uses of arrays.

Although laden with bugs, this project maintains the basic functionality of a calculator. I could not yet figure out a way to make the calculations continue after a result, without inputting an operator. The user will have to hit the `C` button if he intends to start a new calculation. `1 + 2 = 3` and you have to hit the `C` to continue with `5 + 6`. Most of the other bugs are related 
to this. (1 + 2 - 3 * 4 would work).

These bugs stem from the fact that I did not arrange my logic systematically at the beginning of the project. I have learnt and I must move on.

I hope to revisit this project in the nearest future, refactor the functions and make the more efficient.

See you around.
